## Profile
I’m a Senior Software Engineer with 25 years of experience in the industry. I’ve worked for
several companies in Brazil, Portugal, France, England, Ireland, Germany, Lithuania and
Sweden, through different projects in Banking, Healthcare, Construction, Sales and Sports and
Leisure. I’m passionate about making products that are going to, or are already changing
people’s lives, and I’m proud that I have been part of major projects that were aimed at that goal.

## Key Achievements
* Having started my career in 1999 as a support technician, in my first job I was regarded
as a very resourceful person, often solving problems other people struggled to solve;
* In 2001, working as a VB6 programmer, I created one of the largest systems for
sports clubs and gyms in existence on the market in Brazil. It took 3 years to
complete the project, but there are still clubs using it to this day;
* In 2004 I was hired by one of the biggest clubs in Rio de Janeiro to create a version of my
system using newer technology - C# .Net 2.0, SQL Server 2000, ASP.Net, Javascript
and jQuery were used to create an Intranet version of the system. The new system
would have several modules, including access point control using bar code and
fingerprint scanners. The resulting system is in place and working to this day;
* In 2010, while working for a big software company with many customers around the
world, I was hired to be part of a team of 5 people to develop a system directly on the
client’s infrastructure. I was able to cut the development time in half using my
experience in web development, which I had the privilege to share with my peers, using
WPF, C#, Javascript (ES5), jQuery;
* In 2012 I was hired to create a new version of a system for Blatchford & Sons, in the UK.
It was again a job of reverse-engineering an existing piece of software to create a better
one, using the most up-to-date technology stack. Being part of a team of 4 people, we
were able to finish it in 8 months, 4 months prior to what was proposed.
* I was able to implement several major features on this system, including native HTML
documents editing, real time notifications and major security changes.
* Since the company didn’t have any methodology implemented, I installed and managed
an Open Source ticketing system to start making a proper workflow for this client.
After that, we started to have daily meetings to discuss progress of pending features and
bug fixes, which was very beneficial for both the customer and the company;
* Only two weeks into the job at Avi Medical GmbH, in Munich, I had already created the
entire database schema documentation as well as a hiring guide book for new
developers entering the team;
* At IKEA as a contractor (3rd party) I was part of the Cyber Security Engineering Group,
back-end API team, writing an application that manages security risks for IKEA's catalogue of over 3600 systems.

## Career History

> Owner, ezSystems Consulting Lda.           *             Sep 2022 – 

After so many years filling positions in companies all over the world, now I decided to go "all in"! Working alongside companies of all sizes, my job is to make sure they succeed! From migration of projects that are currently stuck with an old tech-stack to greefield projects, from start-ups that are struggling to deploy their MVP to companies that are just trying to add features to an existing product, I've been enjoying to work with so many interesting projects and people!

Currently advocating for the going #backtothessr and the usage of Open Source technologies in development, I've been studying and actively using native Web Components in my projects with huge success, specially in terms of maintenance and scalability! Being platform and framework-agnostic, I believe that native Web Components are the definitive answer to a healthy development environment and the proper way to create components you REALLY can reuse on any project!

Techs we use at ezSystems are, mainly, NodeJS, Express/Fastify (although we've been experimenting with Koa), JWT, Socket.io, ETA, Vue3 (with Vite), Web Components, custom events, ECMAScript 2022 and TypeScript (back and front-end, depending on the framework and the demands of the project); our back-end normally consists of a MySQL or PostgreSQL database, micro-services in Node or .Net Core C# (again, depending on the demands of the clients), Jest, RabbitMQ, Redis etc. and various libraries to support the development, such as PrimeFaces, Shoelace, Bootstrap etc.

> Senior Software Engineer, IKEA (via Nexere Ltd.)        *        Apr 2022 – Sep 2022

Acting as a back-end engineer for the project, part of the cyber security group, writing APIs that are being used by one of
the newest products in the company. Working in an Agile environment directly with the Project
Owner to make sure we delivered the next versions in time - V2 is currently live.
Technologies involved included NodeJS with Fastify, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud VPSs, Microsoft AD (for SSO) and more.

> Senior Software Engineer, InControl Lda.           *             Jun 2021 – Apr 2022

Acting as a Full-stack Developer for the creation of new versions of their systems (currently
Delphi 7 with IntraWeb) to upgrade and transform the entire tech-stack for the company. I’m
actively involved in everything related to the projects, from designing the interfaces, UX, creating
the services, gateway and APIs, to giving training and sharing my experience with other
developers on the team. Technologies involved were ECMA-2021, jQuery, HTML5, SCSS,
MySQL 8, NodeJS/Express, React, Jira and many others.

> Senior Software Engineer, Avi Medical GmbH            *          Aug 2020 – Jun 2021

My responsibilities as a Senior Engineer at Avi Medical surpass the day-to-day coding routine,
helping interviewing new candidates, evaluating technical skills, writing documentation, doing
code reviews, coordinating external service providers with our internal team to make sure our
project is moving in the correct direction, as well as daily meetings, retrospectives, sprint reviews
etc. as per the Agile methodology. On the technical side, my job is to make decisions about API
endpoints, data payload, database schema, authentication/authorization methods and anything
else regarding our main project being developed. Technologies involved: Digital Ocean
VPS, MySQL 8, NodeJS, ReactJS, Jira and many others.

> Freelance contracts, multiple companies             *           Mar 2020 – Dec 2020

Mobile and Web development of various types, using various technologies during the worst part
of the pandemic. Mostly working on REST APIs with NodeJS and Express/Fastify, and React web
development for admin dashboards, landing pages and other general purpose websites.

> Full-stack Developer, WebAmericas Ltd.            *            Nov 2011 – Nov 2019

Greenfield project, reverse-engineered from the old version the company used. I defined the
basic structure of the system and the tech stack - C# .Net 4 and SQL Server 2012 on the backend, with the front-end made on Javascript (ES5) and jQuery. I created the basic framework we
used throughout the entire system (Bootstrap/jQuery), with proper web components that could
be reused and set up easily. In the last 3 years at the company I pushed towards newer
technologies, so we started to work with NodeJS, WebSockets, Mocha and AngularJS.
- I created a reusable UI framework with Javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS
- Towards the end of the project, I started to use AngularJS and NodeJS to build components
- I used a pure MVC architecture approach, having the POC-Objects for model, HTML/CSS
pages as views and Javascript for the controller, using AJAX to pass data back and forth
- I implemented an Agile ticketing system to track bugs and feature requests (OpenProject)
