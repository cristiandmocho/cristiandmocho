## Profile
I’m a Senior Software Engineer with over 21 years of experience in the industry. I’ve worked for
several companies in Brazil, Portugal, France, England, Ireland, Germany, Lithuania and
Sweden, through different projects in Banking, Healthcare, Construction, Sales and Sports and
Leisure. I’m passionate about making products that are going to, or are already changing
people’s lives, and I’m proud that I have been part of major projects that were aimed at that goal.

## Key Achievements
* Having started my career in 1999 as a support technician, in my first job I was regarded
as a very resourceful person, often solving problems other people struggled to solve;
* In 2001, working as a VB6 programmer, I created one of the largest systems for
sports clubs and gyms in existence on the market in Brazil. It took 3 years to
complete the project, but there are still clubs using it to this day;
* In 2004 I was hired by one of the biggest clubs in Rio de Janeiro to create a version of my
system using newer technology - C# .Net 2.0, SQL Server 2000, ASP.Net, Javascript
and jQuery were used to create an Intranet version of the system. The new system
would have several modules, including access point control using bar code and
fingerprint scanners. The resulting system is in place and working to this day;
* In 2010, while working for a big software company with many customers around the
world, I was hired to be part of a team of 5 people to develop a system directly on the
client’s infrastructure. I was able to cut the development time in half using my
experience in web development, which I had the privilege to share with my peers, using
WPF, C#, Javascript (ES5), jQuery;
* In 2012 I was hired to create a new version of a system for Blatchford & Sons, in the UK.
It was again a job of reverse-engineering an existing piece of software to create a better
one, using the most up-to-date technology stack. Being part of a team of 4 people, we
were able to finish it in 8 months, 4 months prior to what was proposed.
* I was able to implement several major features on this system, including native HTML
documents editing, real time notifications and major security changes.
* Since the company didn’t have any methodology implemented, I installed and managed
an Open Source ticketing system to start making a proper workflow for this client.
After that, we started to have daily meetings to discuss progress of pending features and
bug fixes, which was very beneficial for both the customer and the company;
* Only two weeks into the job at Avi Medical GmbH, in Munich, I had already created the
entire database schema documentation as well as a hiring guide book for new
developers entering the team;
* Now at IKEA as a contractor (3rd party) I’m part of the Cyber Security Engineering Group,
writing software that will be used by the entire company.

## Career History

> Senior Software Engineer, Avi Medical GmbH            *          Aug 2020 – Jun 2021

My responsibilities as a Senior Engineer at Avi Medical surpass the day-to-day coding routine,

code reviews, coordinating external service providers with our internal team to make sure our
project is moving in the correct direction, as well as daily meetings, retrospectives, sprint reviews
etc. as per the Agile methodology. On the technical side, my job is to make decisions about API

Mobile and Web development of various types, using various technologies during the worst part
of the pandemic. Mostly working on REST APIs with NodeJS and Express/Fastify, and React web
development for admin dashboards, landing pages and other general purpose websites.

> Full-stack Developer, WebAmericas Ltd.            *            Nov 2011 – Nov 2019

Greenfield project, reverse-engineered from the old version the company used. I defined the
basic structure of the system and the tech stack - C# .Net 4 and SQL Server 2012 on the backend, with the front-end made on Javascript (ES5) and jQuery. I created the basic framework we
used throughout the entire system (Bootstrap/jQuery), with proper web components that could
be reused and set up easily. In the last 3 years at the company I pushed towards newer
technologies, so we started to work with NodeJS, WebSockets, Mocha and AngularJS.
- I created a reusable UI framework with Javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS
- Towards the end of the project, I started to use AngularJS and NodeJS to build components
- I used a pure MVC architecture approach, having the POC-Objects for model, HTML/CSS
pages as views and Javascript for the controller, using AJAX to pass data back and forth
- I implemented an Agile ticketing system to track bugs and feature requests (OpenProject)
