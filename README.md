## PROFILE
I’m a Senior Software Engineer (back-end first) with 25 years of experience in the industry. I’ve worked for several companies in 8 countries, through different projects in Banking, Healthcare, Construction, e-Commerce and Sports and Leisure. I’m passionate about making products that are going to, or are already changing people’s lives, and I’m proud that I have been part of major projects that were aimed at that goal. A true problem-solver, fast and eager to learn!

## KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
- April 2023 I was called back to collaborate with Blatchford & Sons. I put to work a script to import product and price data from another system, that was parked for four years, allowing them to monthly invoice products that, summed up, ammount to 100,000.00 £ in profits for the forseable future;
- In 2023, in my first month at Compleet GmbH (new client of ezSystems Ltd.) I created a mock API server for the main applications that cuts in 20% the developers’ environment setup time, making onboarding of new team members easier and quicker;
- In 2020, only two weeks into the job at Avi Medical GmbH, in Munich, I had already created the entire database schema documentation as well as a hiring guide book for front-end developers interviews;
- In 2012 I was hired to create a new version of a system for Blatchford & Sons, in the UK. Being part of a team of 4 people, we were able to finish it 33% faster due to my experience in creating reusable code;
- In 2010, while working at Stefanini, in Brazil, I was able to cut the development time in half due to the clarification of project requirements and fast implementation of features;
- In 2001, working as a VB6 programmer, I created one of the largest systems in terms of available features, for sports clubs and gyms in existence on the market in Brazil. It took 3 years to complete the project, but there are still clubs using it to this day;
